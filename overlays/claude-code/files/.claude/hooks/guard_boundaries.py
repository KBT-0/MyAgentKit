"""PostToolUse(Edit|Write): catch a forbidden import the moment it is written.

CI catches it too. This hook only shortens the feedback loop from "next commit" to "next
second", which is the difference between a one-line fix and an argument with a rebase.

Configured by the setup interview: one entry per enforced boundary, mirroring the greps in
scripts/check.sh. If the two disagree, scripts/check.sh is the authority — it is what CI
runs, and this file is convenience for a single tool.
