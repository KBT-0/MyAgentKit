"""PreToolUse(Bash): refuse a destructive git command while work is uncommitted.

`git reset --hard`, `git checkout -- <path>`, `git restore`, `git stash drop/clear`,
`git clean -f` and a force push all discard work that git cannot get back. Uncommitted
changes are not in the reflog: once they are gone, they are gone, and the only copy may
have been something a human wrote by hand.

This is not a style rule. An agent tidying up after itself will eventually run one of these
with somebody else's uncommitted work in the tree, and the loss is silent — the command
succeeds, prints nothing alarming, and the next `git status` looks clean.

The rule enforced here: **commit or stash first, then destroy.** The hook does not decide
whether the command is a good idea; it only refuses to let it take work nobody saved.

Exit 2 blocks the call and returns the message to the agent (Claude Code hook protocol).
